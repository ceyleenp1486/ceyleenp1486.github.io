Starting out in this class, things have been so far pretty interesting. Has it been easy? Not completely but I enjoy a challenge. I have a feeling that this course will be just as exciting(Or perhaps even more!) as the previous courses I took last year about computer science. I can’t help myself from feeling pretty excited for this class. I really have a strong feeling that from the things I'll learn in this class will help me become more creative in the field of computer science. 

So far I’ve learned quite a few things in this class. From things involving the web and what it actually is to the certain things that go in making a page. Such as using certain markup languages like HTML and CSS. I’ll be completely honest here if ahead of time I was told “Hey Ceyleen! You’re gonna be learning about markup languages and make your own blog about what you learn and stuff!” I probably wouldn’t be as interested in comparison to how I am now. I lowkey feared that perhaps this class would be pretty easy and straightforward mixed with a hint of pure boredom. But I was far from being right. All these little pieces that are apart of Computer Science are far from being boring or even easy. But hey, it’s good being thrown challenges from time to time.

So far in this class, the main challenge I’ve been facing is basically understanding how to use code. And where to put that and where to put this. I’ve experienced coding in some of my previous classes before but it seems my memories are a bit scattered. I won't say that I  have completely no idea of how to code or what to do. Because it’s definitely not true. But I have confidence that I’ll be able to attack this challenge head on.
