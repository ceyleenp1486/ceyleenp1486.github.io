Bing bang! Another week completed! 
    
I’ve officially made it another week in computer science. Specifically, it’s currently my 33rd day of learning. Who would’ve known? My teacher that's who (¬‿¬)

Yet again, this week wasn’t so bad. It was fairly nice actually! I will admit that there were a few challenges along the way but it wasn’t bad, at least for me, when you actually gave it some thought. However just because I found this week to be not as challenging as some of the previous weeks that doesn’t mean I didn’t learn anything new. Or at least, the things we learned help me grow a better understanding.

During the beginning of this week, me as well as my many peers focused on certain programs. Mainly just two. What were we doing exactly? Well to sum it all up, we were simply messing around with programs. Creating new functions, testing them out, grasping the entire purpose of each program. You know, all that jazz. But there was a certain thing that raised my eyebrow. What was it? It’s something I’ve never heard of in my entire life. A dot accessor. Which supposedly gives you a specific piece of data.. Let me show you what I mean. 

(example)
Explain 
Overall understanding 
Talk about some of the programs you did (???)
Answer : How is a data definition an abstraction of a table?

Introduce ur new program you made on friday (perimeter to area?? maybe) 

In conclusion
