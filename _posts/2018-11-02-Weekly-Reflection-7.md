And so I officially made it to the end of my 7th week of computer science. Time sure does fly fast! Now that I'm thinking about the what we learned over this entire week, I realized that this week wasn't so bad. In fact, it was less difficult and complicated compared to other weeks. Or at least to me anyways. Which was probably due to the fact that I'm already strongly familiar to the content we were learning this week. To me and surely others, this was all review! I truly feel at ease with this week for once. And let me tell you, it sure does feel great!  ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ

Here is some of my code!(contract - test cases - etc)
