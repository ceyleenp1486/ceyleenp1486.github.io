Just like that, I'm in my fifth week of learning about programming within my class of computer science. This week we learned quite a few things. During the beginning of the week we focused on creating flags using the website "code.pyret". We were given the task to choose any flag and attempt to create a image(program) using pyret to represent that flag. We  used several shape and non shape functions to help put our flags together. Programming shapes to create a flag is somewhat of a complex problem. But what I learned is that complex problems tend to be made up of a much of(or even few) simple problems. In this case, creating a complex image that's made of small simple shapes. For a few days, we were given the opportunity to attempt to finish our flags. Some of my peers had no problem finishing their flag. As most likely it required putting together only a few functions. However people like me were sadly unable to finish. Which can be easily shown by looking at my flag here,

Clearly all you see is a red flag with no design whatsoever. Originally, this flag was going to look something like the flag of Liberia. 

Here's part of my coding I've completed but have not placed together yet : 
```
#Simple parts 
RR= rectangle(450,250, "solid", "red")
SB= star(10, "solid", "black")
RP= rectangle(300,20, "solid", "pink")
SO= square(40,"solid","orange")
```

For those who don't understand what this is for, these were the "simple parts" i had to put together in order to make my flag. Of course, they're all in the wrong color. As my original plan was the recolor them once I got the shape design of flag completed. 

I'd be lying if I said that this week wasn't challenging. For me, I believed it was. I started off the week on a shaky start and felt rather lost when we were given time on the computers to work on our program. My pacing with the work I did was rather slow and I remember being often distracted by the simplest of things. I remember feeling rather distressed at my slow pacing and how far behind I was getting. I know we weren't expected to complete our flags this week. The purpose of this activity was to not focus on creating flags but seeing how this activity connects to data. However, you'd be a fool if you believed I will not continue to work on my flag.

I will do my best to overcome these obstacles such as my pacing and confusion. Obtain the courage to ask questions no matter how dumb they may seem and have the courage to fail. Hopefully next week will be much more distasteful. ಥ⌣ಥ o(╥﹏╥)o
