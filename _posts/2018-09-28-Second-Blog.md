It's officially my second week learning about programming within my class of computer science. As I said in my previous blog post, I find this class very interesting. It's not too boring but its not full of fun and simple tasks. I mean this in a good way of course. Since sometimes if you have a little bit TOO much fun you start to get a little distracted. Which may lead to the thing you’re supposed to learn easily go over your head. Personally, I find certain challenges to be intriguing. This class so far is going rather smoothly for now. I of course will be looking forward to more things we'll be learning these next few weeks! (▰˘◡˘▰)

There are a few things I've learned throughout this week. However the main "topic" we were focusing on(Or at least towards the end of the week) was simply coordinates. During the beginning we didn't focus too much on coordinates but more so analyzing certain online games. Writing down small notes on what certain things change over time and what event causes it to do so. Later on the week is where we slowly shifted to our main topic, coordinates.

To help us get a better understanding of coordinates we went through various activities to help refresh our memory on what coordinates are. It wasn't long before we took the information we gathered into the next level. Which was, to be vague, creating codes. We specifically made multiple images involving a picture with a red circle in front of a blue background(which was a rectangle). We had to make multiple images to make it seem like the circle was falling down. To do this we had to adjust certain coordinates to our liking to complete our task. 

As simple as that sounds I noticed(myself included) had trouble with not the coordinates but coding. Some of my fellow peers and me received certain errors due to simple mistakes like adding a space between two words and such. It didn't take too long to learn from our mistakes. I found this activity to be a good refresher and and intro to what we'll be dealing with in the future.

To me, the main "challenge" I had within this week was coordinates. I remember feeling quite confused on which coordinates go where. It didn't help that I kept confusing it with a coordinate GRAPH which is where I went wrong. ಥ_ಥ
