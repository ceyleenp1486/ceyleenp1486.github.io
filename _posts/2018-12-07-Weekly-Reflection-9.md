Ladies and gentlemen, I’m officially back and up again. What a crowd we have tonight! [I say this now but let’s be real here. There’s probably like one other person reading this]. Anyways I’m back so as usual let me reflect a bit. But this time I’ll try to limit my summarizing of the week and try to focus more on actually discussing my thoughts. Since, afterall, it does say “Weekly Reflection 9” NOT “Weekly Summary 9”, if it was my task would be much more simpler. Not that I really want that, I mean I don’t mind but I digress. ╮(─▽─)╭  

This week went by faster than I anticipated, but I guess time is known for flying fast. Remember when I did that poor excuse of a flag (Weekly Reflection 5!), if you don’t let me give you a brief summary. We had to choose one of the many flags of the world and recreate that flag in code.pyret. If you want to know about that experience feel free to check that reflection out. 


This week we’re basically doing a similar process. However this week was a little different, a good different might I add! So, instead of choosing a flag we were required to pick a flag from two options. One flag was complicated than the other option. One could get you a higher grade then the other as well. After we chosen our flag we were sent to a website called fotw.info and do a little research on our chosen flags. [fotw is an acronym for Flags of the World]

I’m not done with this reflection yet! Please check again later :) Hopefully it’ll be done by the end of Sunday.
